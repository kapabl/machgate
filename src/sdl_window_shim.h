 * Renderer-neutral SDL window glue.

 * machismo installs sdl_create_window_wrapper / sdl_set_window_fullscreen_wrapper
 * as trampoline overrides for ANY game whose SDL2 is trampolined (the `_SDL_`
 * prefix; see machismo.c). That's every SDL port regardless of renderer:
 * NecroDancer (bgfx), Shotgun King / Wratch's Den / Scavenger (Sugar), and
 * Mina (the Gothic GLES backend). None of this is bgfx-specific — it used to
 * live in bgfx_shim.c only by accident of history.
 *
 * The window captured here is reached by the per-game renderer shim (which is a
 * separate .so) via dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "sdl_window_get_captured"); the loader
 * is built -rdynamic so these symbols are visible.
